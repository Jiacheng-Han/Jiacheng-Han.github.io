My name is Jiacheng Han (韩家成).

I'm a forth year undergraduate student from School of computer, Beijing Information Science & Technology University. My research interest includes **Medical Image Processing** and **Computer Vision**. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Ke Niu, Beijing Information Science and Technology University.

My name is Jiacheng Han (Èü©ÂÆ∂Êàê).

I'm a third year undergraduate student from School of computer, Beijing Information Science & Technology University. My research interest includes **Medical Image Processing** and **Computer Vision**. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Ke Niu, Beijing Information Science and Technology University.

# üî• News and Plans

- *CFM-UNet: Coupling Local and Global Feature Extraction Networks for Medical Image Segmentation.* has been **accepted** for publication by *Scientific Reports* (JCR Q1) ![![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mrjunjieli/DMC_AEC?style=social&label=Code+Stars)](https://github.com/Jiacheng-Han/CFM-UNet)

- I'm preparing for master's recommendation. You can learn more about my schedule at [my to-do-list](https://jiacheng-han.github.io/posts/2025/01/BAOYAN/).

- Two papers are under review:

  - **<u>Jiacheng Han</u>**, Ke Niu, Jiuyun Cai, KMC-UNet: A KAN-based Multi-Scale Connected U-shaped Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation. (JCR Q1)
